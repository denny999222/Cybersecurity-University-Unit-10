# Cybersecurity-University-Unit-10
Summary: Setup a honeypot and intercept attacks in the wild.

In this assignment, we will set up a basich honeypot and detect/collect information about an attack

Successful configuration/deployment of a honeypot server has 2 key features:

1) An attack surface that is vulnerable or exposed in some way to network-based attacks
2) A network security feature such as an IDS configured to detect and log such attacks
   Illustration of at least one attack against the honeypot that can be detected or logged in a way that captures information    about the attack or the attacker

Which Honeypot(s) did you deploy
Name	Hostname	Honeypot	Attacks
1) mhn-honeypot-1-dionaea	mhn-honeypot-1	dionaea	1,653

2) mhn-honeypot-2-dionaea	mhn-honeypot-2	dionaea	4,231

3) mhn-honeypot-3-dionaea	mhn-honeypot-3	dionaea	2,001

Did you encounter any issues
Had some issues setting up MHN Honeypot VM using GCP (Mac)
